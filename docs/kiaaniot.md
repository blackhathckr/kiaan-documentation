<!-- You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus. -->

## Developers Team

<!-- Run the development server: -->

```bash
UI/UX Designer: Amogh
```
```bash
Frontend Developers: Nikhil & Skanda
```
```bash
Backend Developer: Neeraj
```
```bash
Devops: Neeraj
```

<!-- The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
