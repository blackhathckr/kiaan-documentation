# Kiaan Agrow

**Imagine a new age of agriculture, where data transforms everything.**

<!-- ## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies. -->

## Tech Stack

<!-- Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command: -->

```bash
IDE: VS Code
```

```bash
UI/UX: Figma
```

```bash
Frontend (Library): React
```
```bash
Framework: Tailwind CSS
```
```bash
Backend: Node.js
```
```bash
Backend Framework: Express
```
```bash
Database: MongoDB
```
```bash
API: REST
```
```bash
Version Control: Git
```
```bash
CI/CD: Jenkins
```

```bash
Cloud Hosting: Azure
```

```bash
Development Methodology: Scrum
```


<!-- You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus. -->

## Developers Team

<!-- Run the development server: -->

```bash
UI/UX Designer: Amogh
```
```bash
Frontend Developer: Skanda
```
```bash
Backend Developer: Nikhil
```
```bash
Devops: Neeraj
```

<!-- The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
